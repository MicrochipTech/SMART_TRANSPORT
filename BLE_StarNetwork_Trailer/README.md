## 1. Introduction<a name="step1">

The Smart Transport System is a vital demonstration of how modern industries can utilize Bluetooth LE-enabled IoT networks to significantly improve efficiency, automation, and real-time monitoring of critical assets. In practical applications, such systems are essential for optimizing operations in smart transportation, industrial automation, and intelligent infrastructure management. By facilitating seamless communication between sensors, actuators, and control systems, this technology meets the increasing demand for low-latency, reliable data exchange and control.

The Smart Transport System employs a Bluetooth LE-enabled IoT network with a Bluetooth LE star topology, where the Trailer-Central_Network_Unit acts as the central hub, managing communication between multiple sensors, actuators, and the Cabin-DisplayAndControl_Unit. Upon startup, the Trailer-Central_Network_Unit scans and connects to various Bluetooth LE devices, including the Trailer-Temperature_Monitoring, Trailer-Lighting_Control, Trailer-Door_Control, Trailer-Alarm_Control, Cabin-DisplayAndControl_Unit, Trailer-HVAC_FaultDetection, and Trailer-SolarPanel_Sensor. 

Once connected, all sensors transmit their data to the Trailer Central Network Unit, which then relays the information to the Cabin-Display and Control unit for real-time monitoring and control. 
- The Trailer Temperature Monitoring reports the current temperature to the Trailer Central Network Unit, which also receives the setpoint from the Cabin Display And Control Unit and forwards it to the thermostat. Based on this data, the thermostat regulates the HVAC system accordingly. 
- The Trailer Lighting can be managed directly from the Cabin Display Unit, while the Trailer Door Control can be operated either by physical touch or via the display interface.
- The Trailer Solar Panel Sensor continuously reports voltage levels, which the Trailer Central Network Unit updates on the display. 
- The Trailer HVAC Fault Detection monitors the HVAC motor, detecting states such as motor on, motor off, or potential faults in the fan. 
- If a fault is detected, the Trailer Central Network Unit triggers the Trailer Alarm Control to alert users. 

By establishing a Bluetooth LE star network, this system ensures efficient, low-latency communication between devices, making it ideal for applications in smart transportation, industrial automation, and intelligent building management. This application showcases the Multi-role Multi-Link feature of the WBZ451 curiosity board.

## 3. Hardware Setup<a name="step3">

- In the RNBD451 Add on Board, the gpio pins are not brought out. For this application, the GPIO pin PA0 in the Remote module is connected to an NC pin on the Mikro Bus header. Using the relay we have connected the Solenoid by giving the Gpio pin(PA0) as Input to the relay. And in the same manner Gpio pin(PA0) is given to the Green line of the RGB Module.

### Smart Transport System Modules

#### [Trailer-Central_Network_Unit](https://github.com/MicrochipTech/SMART_TRANSPORT/tree/main/BLE_StarNetwork_Trailer/Trailer-Central_Network_Unit)
This module acts as the central hub of the Bluetooth LE network. It manages communication between all connected sensors, actuators, and the Cabin display and control unit. It is responsible for scanning and connecting to various Bluetooth LE devices, collecting data from them, and relaying this information to the display unit for real-time monitoring and control.

#### [Trailer-Temperature_Monitoring](https://github.com/MicrochipTech/SMART_TRANSPORT/tree/main/BLE_StarNetwork_Trailer/Trailer-Temperature_Monitoring)
This module monitors the temperature inside the trailer. It continuously reports the current temperature to the Trailer-Central_Network_Unit. The central unit also receives the desired temperature setpoint from the Cabin-DisplayAndControl_Unit and forwards it to the thermostat, which then regulates the HVAC system to maintain the set temperature.

#### [Trailer-Lighting_Control](https://github.com/MicrochipTech/SMART_TRANSPORT/tree/main/BLE_StarNetwork_Trailer/Trailer-Lighting_Control)
This module controls the lighting within the trailer. It can be managed directly from the Cabin-DisplayAndControl_Unit, allowing users to turn lights on or off and adjust brightness levels as needed.

#### [Trailer-SolarPanel_Sensor](https://github.com/MicrochipTech/SMART_TRANSPORT/tree/main/BLE_StarNetwork_Trailer/Trailer-SolarPanel_Sensor)
This module continuously monitors the voltage levels of the trailer's solar panels. It reports this data to the Trailer-Central_Network_Unit, which updates the information on the Cabin Display And Control Unit. This helps in ensuring that the solar panels are functioning correctly and efficiently.

#### [Trailer-Door_Control](https://github.com/MicrochipTech/SMART_TRANSPORT/tree/main/BLE_StarNetwork_Trailer/Trailer-Door_Control)
This module manages the operation of the trailer doors. It can be operated either by physical touch or remotely via the Cabin Display And Control Unit. This allows for secure and convenient access control.

#### [Trailer-Alarm_Control](https://github.com/MicrochipTech/RNBD451_HOSTLESS_MODE/blob/main/README.md#to-configure-the-rnbd-remote-module)
This module is responsible for triggering alarms in case of any detected faults or emergencies. If the Trailer Central Network Unit detects an issue, such as a fault in the HVAC system, it activates the Trailer Alarm Control to alert users.

#### [Cabin-DisplayAndControl_Unit]()
This module serves as the user interface for the entire system. It displays real-time data from all connected sensors and allows users to control various aspects of the trailer, such as temperature, lighting, and door operations. It ensures that users have a comprehensive view and control over the trailer's environment.

#### [Trailer-HVAC_FaultDetection]()
This module monitors the HVAC system's motor, detecting its operational state (on, off) and identifying potential faults. If a fault is detected, it sends an alert to the Trailer Central Network Unit, which then triggers the Trailer Alarm Control to notify users.

By integrating these modules into a cohesive Bluetooth LE network, the Smart Transport System ensures efficient, low-latency communication and control, making it ideal for applications in smart transportation, industrial automation, and intelligent building management.
