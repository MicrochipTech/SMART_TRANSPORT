## 1. Introduction<a name="step1">

Trailer-Temperature Monitoring uses a BLE sensor control pipe of the WBZ451 to monitor and manage the temperature within a trailer. The onboard temperature sensor measures the current temperature and sends this data to a central unit, which then relays it to a display. Users can set the desired temperature via the display, and this information is communicated back to the device through the central unit. The HVAC system is controlled based on the current and set temperatures. Additionally, all data can be monitored using the MBD app connected to the central device.

## 4. Harmony MCC Configuration<a name="step5">

### Getting Started with Modbus Server application with the WBZ451 Curiosity Board

| Tip | New users of MPLAB Code Configurator are recommended to go through the [overview](https://onlineDocs.microchip.com/pr/GUID-1F7007B8-9A46-4D03-AEED-650357BA760D-en-US-6/index.html?GUID-AFAB9227-B10C-4FAE-9785-98474664B50A) |
| :- | :- |

**Step 1** - Connect the WBZ451 Curiosity board to the device/system using a micro-USB cable.

**Step 2** - This application is built by using [BLE Sensor Application](https://github.com/Microchip-MPLAB-Harmony/wireless_apps_pic32cxbz2_wbz45/tree/master/apps/ble/advanced_applications/ble_sensor) as the building block. The project graph of the BLE Sensor application is shown below.

| Note | The BLE Sensor application repository can be cloned/downloaded from this [link](https://github.com/Microchip-MPLAB-Harmony/wireless_apps_pic32cxbz2_wbz45). |
| :- | :- |
| File path | wireless_apps_pic32cxbz2_wbz45/apps/ble/advanced_applications/ble_sensor/ firmware/ ble_sensor.x |

**Step 3** - [Generate](https://onlinedocs.microchip.com/pr/GUID-1F7007B8-9A46-4D03-AEED-650357BA760D-en-US-6/index.html?GUID-2EE03524-41FE-4EBA-8646-6D10AA72F365) the code.

**Step 4** - Once generation is complete, the merge window will appear. Merge all the changes shown.  

**Step 5** -  Copy the mentioned files from this repository by navigating to the location mentioned below and replace the generated files.
 
| Note | This application repository should be cloned/downloaded to perform the following steps. |
| :- | :- |
| Path | The application folder can be found in the following [link](https://github.com/MicrochipTech/PIC32CXBZ2_WBZ45x_BLE_UART_MODBUS) |

- Copy the following files from the cloned repo(...\firmware\src).
	- "app.c" and "app.h",
	- "app_ble_sensor.c" and "app_ble_sensor.h",
	- "app_ble_conn_handler.c" and "app_ble_conn_handler.h"
- Replace the above mentioned files in your project folder location(...\firmware\src).

**Step 6** - In "app_user_edits.c", make sure the below code line is commented 

- "#error User action required - manually edit files as described here".

**Step 7** - From projects, go to "app_adv.h" file and add this code in line 104.

```
#define APP_ADV_PROD_TYPE_ST_THERMOSTAT                                             0xA2         /**< Product Type: BLE Temperature Sensor*/
```

**Step 8** - Clean and build the project. To run the project, select "Make and program device" button.

## 6. Board Programming<a name="step6">

### Build and program the application using MPLAB X IDE

The application folder can be found by navigating to the following path: 

- ".../firmware/"

Follow the steps provided in the link to [Build and program the application](https://github.com/Microchip-MPLAB-Harmony/wireless_apps_pic32cxbz2_wbz45/tree/master/apps/ble/advanced_applications/ble_sensor#build-and-program-the-application-guid-3d55fb8a-5995-439d-bcd6-deae7e8e78ad-section).
